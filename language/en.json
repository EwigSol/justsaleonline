This option ensures your ad would show up in every city in the featured listings block located on the left side.\n\nIt's best if you make sure that your posting correctly and completely explains your product or service so that it makes the decision-making process easier for potential buyers. Attention to basic details can make your item stands out among other listings.\n\nYet again, you can post a free ad in minutes, but the aim should not be to just rush through it. Take your time on each step, ensuring the listing will be presentable and free of any mistakes."
